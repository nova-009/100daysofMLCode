## Day 9: 14th July, 2018
### Work Done: 
Attempted to get some intuition by examining domain knowledge features, insipred by <a href=https://www.kaggle.com/jsaguiar/updated-0-792-lb-lightgbm-with-simple-features>Aguiar's kernel</a>. Then, examined the 

## Day 10: 15th July, 2018
### Work Done: 
Performed imputation and normalization of the original features after encoding categorical values. Then used logistic regression to predict the target.

## Day 11: 16th July, 2018
### Work Done: 
Investigating missing value correlation with target.

This <a href=https://github.com/nova-009/InMyFeelingsChallenge/commit/90d1e7a071c767f3fee9af7558a62b92d2c2a8aa>commit</a> to process a video for InMyFeelingsChallenge.

## Day 20: 25th July, 2018
### Work Done: 
Tried PCA to reduce dimensionality of images from 8100(90x90) to 6400, but the reconstructions are not good enough.
