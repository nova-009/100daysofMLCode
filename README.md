# 100daysofMLCode

## Day 0: 5th July, 2018
### Work Done: 
Started working on <a href=https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-credit-default-risk/>Home Credit Default Risk</a> Competition on Kaggle. Explored the columns and distribution of target columns.

## Day 1: 6th July, 2018
### Work Done: 
Exploratory data analysis on Home Credit Risk Data. Examined missing values and anomalies.

## Day 2: 7th July, 2018
### Work Done:
Encoded categorical columns(columns with 2 categories with label encoding and columns with more than 2 categories with one-hot encoding). Aligned training data with test data.

## Day 3: 8th July, 2018
### Work Done: 
Finding correlation of the columns with target.

## Day 4: 9th July, 2018
### Work Done: 
Completed week 1 of Improving Deep Neural Networks on Coursera.

## Day 5: 10th July, 2018
### Work Done: 
Completed week 2 of Improving Deep Neural Networks on Coursera.

## Day 6: 11th July, 2018
### Work Done: 
Studied about hyperparameter tuning and batch normalization on week 3 of Improving Deep Neural Networks on Coursera.

## Day 7: 12th July, 2018
### Work Done: 
Leart to use TensorFlow and built a neural network using TensorFlow to classify images. Completed week 3 of Improving Deep Neural Networks on Coursera.

## Day 8: 13th July, 2018
### Work Done: 
Started Feature Engineering for Home Credit Default Risk. Generated polynomial features for a few columns and investigated their correlations with the target. 
### Outcome:
Some of the polynomial features have a greater correlation with the target than the original features. These features can be helpful in building a better model.

## Day 9: 14th July, 2018
### Work Done: 
Attempted to get some intuition by examining domain knowledge features, insipred by <a href=https://www.kaggle.com/jsaguiar/updated-0-792-lb-lightgbm-with-simple-features>Aguiar's kernel</a>. Then, examined the 
### Outcome:
It is hard to tell from the KDE plots of the domain features if these will have a signifact impact on target.

## Day 10: 15th July, 2018
### Work Done: 
Performed imputation and normalization of the original features after encoding categorical values. Then used logistic regression to predict the target.
### Outcome:
Accuracy for this model is 67%.

## Day 11: 16th July, 2018
### Work Done: 
Investigating missing value correlation with target.
### Outcome:
Applicants with more missing data about housing were found to have more default ratio.
